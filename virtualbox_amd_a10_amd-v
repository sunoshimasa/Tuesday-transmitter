Now for those like me trying to use VB(Oracle VirtualBox ) for using Linux VM under Windows-10 Home And similar HP Laptop ( AMD A10-8700p R6 Radeon) :  I did following to resolve the issue of 64 bit option not being shown in VB:

-- First thing is that this issue is related to BIOS settings and so we need to get into BIOS Menu and so re-start the laptop and keep pressing F2 , it will show HP logo a couple of times and then we can see BIOS diagnostics menu. We need to EXIT from this top Menu ( EXIT --> YES/NO --> Select NO, which will take to next level of Menu).

-- In the Next BIOS Menu, Select ADVANCED option at Top ( use Arrow keys to navigate ). Under ADVANCED Option you can see "svm CPU Virtualization"  with its checkbox as un-checked.   Check this Option and then SAVE and Exit from BIOS Set Up. The Booting of Laptop continues.

-- Shutdown Laptop as soon as it started after BIOS Change as above, and then re-start it, now we should be able to see 64 bit options active in VB Drop-Down.

-- My HP Laptop came with two good set-up utilities from HP called Support Assistant and HP TOuchPoint. These were very helpful initially to upgrade BIOS and other software versions as well as researching the issue of Virtual Box.
